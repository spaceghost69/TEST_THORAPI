# Why Code Generation Needs to Be a Part of Agile

![CodeGen and Agile](https://valkyrlabs.com/assets/app_diagram_white-xPAebe-L.png)

*7 min read*

Agile has seen wide adoption but needs to be seen as a framework for routines and disciplines built around first principles—not as a static monolithic approach to project management. Often, the rituals and incantations around Scrum and grooming are liable to morph and even become lost. Thus, the advantages of Agile are lost, and we are back to facing scope creep, lack of accountability, and perpetual disappointment.

In the fast-paced world of software development, integrating code generation into Agile methodologies is no longer optional—it's essential. Let's explore why.

---

## The Evolution of Agile and the Rise of Code Generation

Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by promoting flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. However, as projects grow in complexity, traditional Agile practices sometimes struggle to keep up with the demands of rapid delivery and high-quality code.

### The Limitations of Manual Coding in Agile

- **Human Error**: Manual coding is prone to typos and inconsistencies.
- **Time-Consuming**: Writing boilerplate code eats up valuable time.
- **Inconsistent Standards**: Different developers may implement features differently, leading to codebase fragmentation.

---

## Code Generation: The Missing Piece in Agile

By integrating code generation into Agile practices, teams can:

- **Accelerate Development**: Automate repetitive tasks, freeing up developers to focus on core functionalities.
- **Enhance Quality**: Generate consistent, error-free code adhering to best practices.
- **Improve Collaboration**: Standardized code makes it easier for teams to understand and work on shared codebases.

### How Generated Code Revolutionizes Workflow

As discussed in our previous article, **"Unleash the Power of ThorAPI: Transform Your Front-End Development,"** generated code is more than just a shortcut—it's a revolution.

> "Generated code is predictable, reliable, and standardized—eliminating entire classes of errors caused by human oversight."

## Bridging the Gap Between Planning and Execution

Often, Agile rituals like sprint planning and retrospectives become routine, losing their effectiveness. Integrating code generation revitalizes these practices by providing tangible tools that enhance productivity.

### Revitalizing Agile Rituals

- **Sprint Planning**: With code generation, teams can more accurately estimate effort and deliverables.
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Identify blockers related to code generation tools and address them promptly.
- **Retrospectives**: Analyze the impact of code generation on velocity and quality, adjusting processes as needed.

## Real-World Impact: Code Generation in Action

Let's revisit some insights from our previous discussions:

### The Double-Edged Sword of Automation

In our article, **"In Our Mad Dash for Progress: What Are We Giving Up in Return?"**, we highlighted how automation can be both a boon and a bane.

> "While code rewriting and template-based generation have streamlined development processes, they come with their own set of challenges."

### Overcoming the Pitfalls

By adopting best practices and modern tools, teams can mitigate the downsides of automation:

- **Use Reliable Tools**: Opt for commercial solutions that offer support and regular updates.
- **Maintain Code Quality**: Regular code reviews and adherence to coding standards ensure maintainability.

---

## Best Practices for Integrating Code Generation into Agile

1. **Define Clear Templates**: Establish code generation templates that adhere to your team's coding standards.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Incorporate code generation into your CI/CD pipeline for seamless updates.
3. **Regular Training**: Ensure the team is proficient with code generation tools and understands their benefits.
4. **Feedback Loops**: Use retrospectives to gather feedback on the code generation process and make iterative improvements.

## Overcoming Resistance and Embracing Change

Change can be challenging. Team members might resist integrating code generation due to fear of the unknown or job security concerns.

### Addressing Concerns

- **Education**: Highlight how code generation enhances their roles rather than replacing them.
- **Demonstrate Value**: Showcase quick wins and improvements in productivity.
- **Encourage Participation**: Involve the team in selecting and customizing code generation tools.

## Conclusion: The Future of Agile is Automated

Incorporating code generation into Agile isn't about replacing developers; it's about empowering them. By automating the mundane, teams can focus on innovation, problem-solving, and delivering exceptional value to customers.

**Agile's next evolution is here. Are you ready to embrace it?**
