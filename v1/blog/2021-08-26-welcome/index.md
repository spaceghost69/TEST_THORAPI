## Signposts on the Road to the Singularity

We are at an inflection point of automation—there is still work. For now...

As we hurtle towards an AI-driven future, have we stopped to consider what we're leaving behind? In our relentless pursuit of progress, are we overlooking the subtle signs that we're automating ourselves out of existence?

When I was running an enterprise software tools company, I noticed a fascinating trend: what enterprises were doing today, consumers would adopt in 3-5 years. Technologies like analytics, cloud computing, and web publishing were once exclusive to big businesses but soon trickled down to everyday users.

But here's the twist: now, whatever consumers are doing, enterprises are adopting in 3-5 years. The roles have reversed. Consumerization of IT means that the latest apps and tools are influencing corporate strategies, not the other way around.

## The Acceleration of Automation

It's like Moore's Law for acronyms. Every few years, the software industry doubles in complexity, commoditizes the latest innovations, and packages them into user-friendly apps for the masses.

Imagine browsing through an enterprise's IT inventory, picking a random, important-sounding acronym, and in a few years, there's a mobile app for that.

- **Consumer ERP apps** for managing personal projects.
- **HR apps** for hiring nannies.
- **On-demand server instances** for hosting anything from cat memes to indie games.

If it's not in the app store yet, it's only a matter of time.

## Future-Proofing Your Career in the Age of Automation

I was watching my friend Mark Fidelman's video series on future-proofing one's career through personal branding. He suggests that automation and globalization are in full swing, and many are unprepared for the waves of change on the horizon.

At first, I thought I was immune. As an entrepreneur and developer, I believed my skills were irreplaceable—at least for now. But then I realized: no one is safe from automation.

## The Rise of the "Super-Enabled" Individual

In over 20 years of startup entrepreneurship, I've developed some "renegade rules." One of them is to always "think different." Observe the crowd but don't follow it. Scout ahead, devise a plan, and execute a strategy that's uniquely yours.

### The Power of Agility

In the Japanese martial art of Aikido, a smaller opponent can leverage a larger opponent's weight and momentum, throwing them to the ground with ease. Being small and agile becomes your advantage.

Malcolm Gladwell's book *David and Goliath* explores this concept, highlighting the hidden strengths of underdogs.

## Disrupting the Disruptors

Startups have a unique ability to adapt and exploit disruptive technologies. Their agility allows them to make bold, fast moves that larger companies can't match without risking their customer base.

Consider how Uber dismantled local taxi markets. By bypassing traditional barriers like taxi badges and fleet maintenance costs, they redefined the competitive landscape.

## The Innovator's Dilemma and Business-Model Lock-in

Large companies often suffer from "Business-Model Lock-in," a specific incarnation of the Innovator's Dilemma. Their sunk costs and established practices prevent them from pivoting quickly.

For example, imagine if Microsoft decided to open-source Windows. The logistical and branding challenges would be monumental. As a small company, we could make such a pivot in a single day.

## The Underdog Advantage

Take "Brooks's Law": adding more developers to a late project only makes it later. Large teams introduce friction, overhead, and inefficiencies that small teams can avoid.

At my company, Extentech, we faced our own challenges with legacy code and resource constraints. Our "technical debt" hindered our ability to innovate rapidly.

## The Future Is Now

If current trends continue—and we don't find ourselves back in the Stone Age due to unforeseen catastrophes—I predict that the barriers to launching sophisticated startups will continue to fall. Incumbent industries will lose their ability to play "prevent defense."

Over the next five years, the best micropreneurs will begin to outmaneuver big companies, leveraging agility and innovation to disrupt established markets.

## Conclusion: Embracing Change Before It Embraces You

As automation accelerates, we must adapt or risk becoming obsolete. The key is to leverage our unique strengths—agility, creativity, and the willingness to disrupt ourselves before someone else does.

**So, should we pump the brakes on AI? Or should we strap in and steer the course?**
