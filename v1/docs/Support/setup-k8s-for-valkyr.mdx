# Kubernetes Configuration for Peragon Services

When it comes to scaling your stack, Kubernetes is the goto as a great, easy and approachable way to get scaled up (or down) for very little upfront cost.

# Pros and Cons

Pros:
 - total deployment flexibility in the cloud and behind the firewall
 - incredible horizontal scalability of compute across many redundant processing nodes
 - pretty good vertical scaling on commodity hardware via object storage and replication strategies
 - awesome portability of applications across cloud and premise-based resources
 - application upgrades can be rolled out incredibly smoothly
 - load balancing and fail over provide great fault tolerance

Cons:
 - can get extremely complicated fast, requiring knowledge of operating systems as well as networking and programming to fully manage
 - bugs can be excruciating to eliminate as they may cross system domains, operating systems, languages, and often layers of the OSI stack
 - spinning up new clusters is a slow process vs. restarting a single server or even a set of load balanced servers
 - mistakes can be incredibly expensive in downtime or excessive uptime (cloud instance fees)

# What are the setup steps to get this going?

- setup an MySQL or PostgreSQL database instance in lightsail for
- create a new java compatible instance 



# Setting up Apache and Percival the Dragon Slayer on the Instance

**Setup Apache to serve the Front End and proxy the REST api**

After making the changes, restart apache.

```
bitnami@valkyrlabs:/$ sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart apache
```
**Setup System Services to Launch the Backend**

```
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/valkyrai.service

...


--spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://ls-8ee50fe55eacc4884310f11919fc27eabb42aee7.cjbdbnvzknle.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/jamroom


...


```

then start the service... 

```
bitnami@valkyrlabs:/$ sudo systemctl start valkyrai.service

```

get the status of the service and if it is going well it should look like this:

```
bitnami@valkyrlabs:~/stack/apache/conf$ sudo systemctl status valkyrai.service
