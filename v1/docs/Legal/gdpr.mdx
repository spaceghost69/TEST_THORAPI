# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance Policy

**Effective Date**: 2024-10-07

Peragon Games INC. ("We", "Us", "Our", or the "Company") is committed to complying with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). This GDPR Compliance Policy outlines our obligations as a data controller and data processor, the rights of individuals whose personal data we process, and how we manage and protect such data.

## 1. **Roles and Responsibilities**
- **Data Controller**: Peragon Games INC. acts as the data controller for personal data we collect from users within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK.
- **Data Processor**: We may also act as a data processor for customers who use our Services to process personal data.

## 2. **Lawful Basis for Processing**
We only process personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so, such as:
- **Consent**: Where the individual has given clear consent for us to process their data.
- **Contractual Necessity**: To fulfill contractual obligations.
- **Legal Obligation**: To comply with legal obligations.
- **Legitimate Interests**: Where processing is necessary for our legitimate business interests, except where overridden by the individualâ€™s interests or fundamental rights.

## 3. **Data Subject Rights**
Under the GDPR, individuals have the following rights:
- **Right to Access**: You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you.
- **Right to Rectification**: You can request corrections to any inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Right to Erasure** ("Right to be Forgotten"): You may request the deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances.
- **Right to Restriction of Processing**: You can request that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
- **Right to Data Portability**: You can request a copy of your personal data in a structured, machine-readable format, and ask us to transfer it to another service provider.
- **Right to Object**: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, particularly in relation to direct marketing.
- **Right Not to Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making**: You have the right not to be subject to decisions made solely by automated means, including profiling, which have legal or similarly significant effects.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at legal@valkyrlabs.com.

## 4. **International Transfers**
We may transfer personal data outside of the EEA or UK to the United States or other countries. When such transfers occur, we ensure that appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful mechanisms) are in place to protect personal data.

## 5. **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**
If you are a customer based in the EEA or UK and use our Services to process personal data, we are required to enter into a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with you. This DPA outlines our responsibilities as a data processor, including:
- **Instructions**: We process personal data only on documented instructions from the data controller.
- **Confidentiality**: We ensure that personnel authorized to process personal data are bound by confidentiality obligations.
- **Security**: We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the personal data.
- **Sub-Processing**: We only engage sub-processors with prior authorization from the data controller and under written contracts.
- **Data Breach Notification**: We will notify the data controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach.
- **Data Retention**: We will return or delete personal data at the end of the contract unless required to retain it by law.

## 6. **Data Security**
We use industry-standard security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no security system is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## 7. **Data Breaches**
In the event of a data breach, we will:
- Notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.
- Notify affected individuals where there is a high risk to their rights and freedoms.
- Take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of the breach and prevent future incidents.

## 8. **Supervisory Authority**
If you are located in the EEA or UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority if you believe that we have not complied with the GDPR.
