## Introduction

Encrypting data in transit using SSL/TLS is a standard security practice. However, once data reaches its destinationâ€”be it a device, database, or memoryâ€”it's vulnerable to unauthorized access. **ThorAPI SecureField** addresses this critical gap by providing robust encryption of data at rest and in memory, ensuring sensitive information remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

## The Limitations of Traditional Encryption

### Beyond SSL/TLS

- **Data Exposure Post-Transit**: SSL/TLS secures data during transmission but not after it arrives.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Data dumps from SQL queries or memory snapshots can expose unencrypted sensitive data.
- **Insider Threats**: Unauthorized internal access can lead to data breaches.

### The Need for Enhanced Protection

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Industries like finance and healthcare require stringent data security measures.
- **Advanced Threats**: Cyberattacks targeting data at rest are increasing in sophistication.

## Introducing ThorAPI SecureField

### What is SecureField?

**ThorAPI SecureField** is a powerful solution that encrypts individual fields within your data structures. The encrypted values are only decrypted at the moment of field access by secure, authorized application code.

### Key Features

- **Per-Field Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive fields individually, minimizing exposure.
- **In-Memory Encryption**: Protects data even when loaded into system memory.
- **On-Demand Decryption**: Fields are decrypted only when accessed by authorized users or processes.

## The Power of Code Generation in Security

### Locking Down the Codebase

- **Immutable Implementations**: **CodeGen** ensures that large portions of the codebase are generated in a secure, unmodifiable manner.
- **Consistency**: Automated code generation reduces human error and enforces security standards across all code.
- **Efficiency**: Developers can focus on innovation while security best practices are automatically applied.

### Advantages

- **Tamper-Proof Code**: Generated code is less susceptible to vulnerabilities introduced by manual coding.
- **Scalable Security**: Easily apply security measures across extensive codebases.

## Integrating with Spring ACL-Based RBAC System

### Fine-Grained Access Control

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manages permissions based on user roles, objects, and fields.
- **Per-User/Per-Object/Per-Field Permissions**: Granular control over who can decrypt and access specific data.

### Empowering Secure Data Operations

- **Controlled Data Exports**: Securely export data with decryption permissions tailored to each user.
- **Secure UX Systems**: Front-end applications can display sensitive data securely, enhancing user trust.

## How ThorAPI SecureField Works

1. **Data Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive fields are encrypted using strong algorithms when stored in databases.
2. **In-Memory Encryption**: Data remains encrypted in memory, reducing the risk from memory dumps.
3. **Secure Field Access**: Fields are decrypted only at the last instant upon access by secured application code.
4. **Access Control Enforcement**: Integration with Spring ACL ensures only authorized users can decrypt data.
5. **Audit and Compliance**: All access and decryption events are logged for monitoring and compliance purposes.
