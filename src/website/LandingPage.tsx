                The Legend of Percival
              </h2>
              <p>
                Born under the celestial alignment of the Twin Suns, Percival was destined for greatness. Trained by the ancient order of dragon slayers, he has mastered the art of combat, forging his path to greatness. But his journey is fraught with peril, for Peragon, the king of dragons, has vowed to annihilate humanity.
              </p>
              <p>
                With every strike of his blade, Percival fights not just for survival but for the soul of a world on the brink of destruction. From storming castle ruins to navigating treacherous caves, his journey is one of unyielding courage and relentless determination.
